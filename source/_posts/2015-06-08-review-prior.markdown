The Flow or Passage of time: whatever is happening, has happened, or will happen is all the time 'becoming more past' in a extended sense.

The *rate* of this flow or passage: exactly is how we measure the time.

*Things* that change, events don't change but *happen*.

Events *are* changes.

Changes do change, but this does not leave everything quite simple and solved. For there's still something odd about the change that we describe figuratively as the flow or passage of time.

The change from past to further past isn't one that occurs while the event is occurring. 

We can distingush between the history that an event *has*, and the bit of history that it *is*. The bit of hostory that Queen Anne's death is, or was, is a very very short bit, but that doesn't prevent the history that it has from being indefinitely long.

Augustine's problem: Is a long time long? Is it long when it is present, or when it is past or future? We may resate: dose a process go on for a long time--while it is going on, or when it lies ahead of us, or is all over?

Augustine's anwser: It is when it is present that a time is long, for only that is can be long or short. It is when they are going on that they go on for a long time.

Augustine's hypotheses: the past and the future, and past and future events, in some sense after all 'are'.

Tense-adverbs are adverbs, not verbs.
