<h1 id="independent-account-of-the-phenomenology-of-time">1. Independent account of the phenomenology of time</h1>

<p>There are two kinds of ostensibly recorded facts (which are temporal and recorded by some sentences):</p>

<ol>
  <li>intra-subjective fact</li>
  <li>trans-subjective fact</li>
</ol>

<p>It seems intra-subjective fact is logically more primitive and simpler than trans-subjective fact. So we consider the former first.</p>

<p>The temporal characteristics of experiences fall into three sets:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Every experience has some duration.</li>
  <li>If $A$ and $B$ are two experiences of the same person, and no assumption is made about the relative durations of $A$ and $B$, there are <em>13</em> aleternative possible relations in which $A$ may stand to $B$: 6 are independent of the raltive duration of $A$ and $B$. 1 is exact temporal coincidence without overlap (hold only if $A$ and $B$ have equal duration); 3 hold only if $A$ is shorter than $B$; 3 hold only if $A$ is longer than $B$.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup></li>
  <li>The facts recorded would be changing for the becoming of experiences.</li>
</ol>

<p>Def. “the Extensive Aspect of Temporal Facts”: the two aspects of duration and temporal relations, in which there is a close analogy between Time and Space.</p>

<h2 id="the-extensive-aspect-of-temporal-facts">1.1. The extensive aspect of temporal facts</h2>

<p>There is a ananlogy between a person’s mental history, taken as a whole, and a cord made up of shorter strands in colour or texture arranged in a defined way.</p>

<p>(1) In a linear spatial series there is no asymmetric dyadic relaion intrinsic to the seies. The only relation which does not involve a tacit reference to some term outside the series is the partly symmetrical and partly asymmetrical <em>triadic</em> relation of “betweenness”. In a temporal series there is a genuine dyadic relation which is intrinsic to the series and involves no reference to any term outside the latter. It is the fundamental relation here, and <em>temporal</em> betweenness is defiable in terms of it.</p>

<p>In the temporal series there are two intrinsically opposite directions. In the linear spatial series there is no <em>intrinsic</em> direction. If direction is to be introduces, this must be done <em>extrinsically</em>.</p>

<p>(2) Spatial extension and the occurrence of spatial relations <em>presuppose</em> temporal duration and a certain determinate form of temporal relation. Shape and size are commonly ascribed to particulars which persist through periods of time and have histories of longer or shorter duration.</p>

<p>We do not very often apply the notions of shapes and size to events or processes, as distinct from material things. We talk of spatial relations between two events only when each is sensibly instantaneous and the two are simultaneous with each other. And we talk of spatial relations between two material things only when the histories of two things must go on parallel to each other in time. There is a rather elaborate and complicated temporal relation implied in talking of spatial relations between bodies.</p>

<hr />

<p>Temporal relations <em>directly</em> relate <em>events or processes</em>, not the continuants of which events and processes constitute the histories. Events or processes are temporally eextended. The continuants, of which these events or processes constitute the histories, <em>endure through</em> periods of time. And the period through which a continuant endure is measured by the length of its history.</p>

<p>Lately, a temporal whole may be composed of parts which do not temporally overlap but are completely successive to each other. </p>

<h2 id="the-transitory-aspect-of-temporal-facts">1.2 The transitory aspect of temporal facts</h2>

<p>Here are two points to be considered: (1) the characteristics of pastness, presentness, and futurity; (2) the fact that every event is continually changing in respect of these characteristics.</p>

<p>There are two different ways of recording temporal facts:</p>

<ol>
  <li>by means of differences of tense in inflected languages, or by means of a temporal copula.</li>
  <li>by means of a single uniform copula and temporal adjectives.</li>
</ol>

<p>By useing various forms of temporal adjective we may be able to reduce the number of forms of temporal copula needed in recording temporal facts to the single copula “is”. </p>

<p>Suppose that, on a certain occasion, I utter the sentence “The event $e$ is present.” And suppose that this utterance records a fact. If the word “is” in it were a non-tmeporal copula, <em>every</em> utterance by me of the same sentence would record the same fact, no matter whether it were earlier than, contemporary with, or later than this utterance of mine. But actually the only utterances of this sentence which sould record the same fact as this utterance of mine would be those which are <em>contemporary with</em> my utterance.</p>

<h3 id="pastness-presentness-and-futurity">1.2.1 Pastness, presentness, and futurity</h3>

<p>If we regard them as three determinates under a single determinable, they are not on a level. Pastness and futurity are each capable of an infinite range of different degrees. Presentness is generally thought of as being incaplble of variation in degree. If we want to put them on a level, we must take as our ultimate determinates presentness, the various determinate degrees of pastness, and the various determinate degrees of futurity.</p>

<p>When we do this, we are faced with the following complication. Ant experience has some duration, but presentness, nor absolutely [finitely] determinate degree of  pastness or futurity can not characterise a temporally extended term. </p>

<p>And the notions of strict presentness and of perfectly determinate degrees of pastness or futurity are inseparably bound up with the notion of strictly instantaneous terms (analogously, a point): I call them “event-particles”.</p>

<p>The experiences of prehending boundary of lines are the sensible basis of the notion of lines without breadth. Let us now pass from the apatial analogy to the temporal problem. And the experience of temporal boundaries is the basis of the notion of event-particles. </p>

<p>We can form the conception of a continuous uniform and variable noise-pocess as consisting of a <em>compact</em> series of qualitatively similar (successive)  <em>event-particles</em>, each with its own absolutely determinate <em>temporal position</em> and without any <em>duration</em>. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The real problem may be “what is the topological difference of time we would never-ever know?”. The property of time vs the property of event.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="abolute-becoming">1.2.2 Abolute becoming</h3>

<p>We can not explain or represent temporal becoming in terms of qualitative change or motion, since they presuppose qualitative or substantial persistence, and both presuppose temporal becoming.</p>

<p>We attempt to represent temporal becoming by means of motion. Here we are supposed of have a series of event-paricles related by the relation of earlier and later. This may be represented by a straight line. The characteristic of presentness is then supposed to move aling this series of event-particles, in the direction from earlier to later.</p>

<p>There are some fatal objections for the “policeman’s bullseye”:</p>

<p>(1) How great a distance will it have traversed in unit time-lapse? But the “distance” should be temporal. In it “distance” <em>is</em> time-lapse. The Question become meaningless.</p>

<p>(2) Consider any event-particle in the series. At a certain moment this acquires presentness, before that moment it was future, afterwards it is past. Now the acquisition and the loss of presentness by this event-particle is itself an event-particle of the second order, which happens to the first-order event-particle. Therefore every first-order event-<em>particle</em> has a <em>history</em> of indefinite length; and, at a certain stage of this there is one outstanding second-order enent-particle. Yet, by defintion, the first-order event-particle which we have been considering has no duration, and therefore can have no history, in the time-series along which presentness is supposed to move.</p>

<p>The two considerations would seem to make this conculsion inevitable: if there is any sense intalking of presentness moving along a series of events, related by the relation of earlier-and-later, we must postulate a <em>second</em> time-dimension in addition to that in which the series is spread out:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Let $e_1$ and $e_2$ be two first-order event-particles, and let $e_1$ precede $e_2$ by $t$ units of the first time-dimension.</li>
  <li>Suppose that the second-order event-particle which is $e_1$’s acquirement of presentness precedes the second-order event-particle (denoted by $e_1^2$)) which is $e_2$’s acquirement of presentness by $t’$ units of the second time-demension (denoted by $e_2^2$).</li>
  <li>Then the velocity with which presentness moves along the original series will be measured by the ratio $t/t’$.</li>
</ol>

<p>Point is: the ratio cannot possibly represent a rate of change unless its denominator measures a <em>lapse of time</em> and its numerator measures something <em>other than</em> a lapse of time in the same time-dimension.</p>

<p>The seires of second-order event-particles, $e_1^2$, $e_2^2$, $e_3^2$, etc., in the second time-dimension, is precisely like the series of first-order event-particles, $e_1$, $e_2$, $e_3$, etc., in all those respects which led people to say that presentness “move along” the first-order seires. Such people ought therefore to say that presentness “moves along” the second-order series too.</p>

<p>We can also use $e_n^3$ to represent a <em>third</em> timedimension, which stands for “the acquirement of presentness by the acquirement of presentness by $e_n$.” And futher.</p>

<p>It is a sign that one has made a false move at the beginning. I think that regarding the “to become present” (<em>absolute becoming</em>)  as “to become hot” (<em>qualitative change</em>) is a mistake.</p>

<p>A literally <em>instantaneous</em> event-particle can significantly be said to “become present”; and, indeed, in the strict sence of ““present” <em>only</em> instantaneous event-paricles can be said to “become present”. To “become present” is, in fact, just to “become”, to “come to pass” or to “happen”. Clearly, qualitative change involves absolute becoming, and it seems to me equally certain that absolue becoming is involved in mere continuance without qualitative change.</p>

<h1 id="mctaggarts-account-of-the-phenomenology-of-time">2. McTaggart’s account of the phenomenology of time</h1>

<h2 id="b-series-and-a-series">2.1. B-series and A-series</h2>

<p>(1) We can classify event-particles into a series of successive sets of mutually similtaneous event-particles (the contents of a single temporal position). McTaggart gives the name of a “B-series” to the such series of sets. Thus the generateing relation of a B-series is the relation “earlier than”.</p>

<p>(2) I think that in so-called “A-series” there is a certain ambiguity in the applicaiton of the term. I will now remove it.</p>

<p>(a) There is what I will call the “series of A-characteristics”. This is simply the series formed by the various possibel degrees of pastness indecreasing order of magnitude, the characteristic of strict presentness, and the various possible degrees of futurity in increasing order of magnitude.</p>

<p>(b) The terms of a B-series constitute also at any moment an “A-series”. They consitute a B-series in virtue of standing in the relation of earlier and later to each other. Ther consitute an A-series in virtue of their one-to-one correslation at every moment with the terms of the series of A-charcteristics.</p>

<p>Every difference in magnitude of the relation “earlier than” is correlated with a difference in the degree of the A-characteristics possessed by the related events. (For this purpose we must count futurity as similar to pastness. And we must take “difference” to mean “algebraical difference”.) Every <em>one</em> event-particle is continually changing in respect of its A-characteristics. But any two event-particles in the same B-series always keep the <em>same algebraic difference</em> between their A-characteristics.</p>

<p>We have two alternative ways to picture the temporal facts by means of an analogy with motion.</p>

<p>(a) We can imagine the B-series standing still as a rigid whole, and the series of A-characteristics sliding along it as a rigid whole in the direction of <em>earlier to later</em>:</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/time_picture_1.png" alt="picture 1" /></p>

<p>Or (b) we can imagine the series of A-characteristics standing still as a rigid whole, and the B-series sliding along it as a rigid whole in the direction from greater to less futurity, through presentness, to greater and greater pastness.</p>

<h2 id="time-change-and-the-two-series">2.2. Time, change and the two series</h2>

<p>What is the relation between these series? </p>

<h3 id="statement-of-mctaggarts-doctrine">2.2.1. Statement of McTaggart’s doctrine</h3>

<p>Suppose that we are given a series of terms related by a transitive asymmetrical relaiton $R$. Suppose further that between any two terms, $x$ and $y$, of this series there is a third term, $z$, which is dissimilar to $x$ in some respect beside occupying a different position in the series from $x$, and which is dissimilar to $y$ in some respect beside occupying a different position in the series from $y$.</p>

<p>Then:</p>

<p>(A) the series <em>cannot</em> be counted as a process of perpetual qualitative change <em>unless</em> $R$ is the relation “earlier than”, and the series is therefore a B-series.</p>

<p>(B) If the relation $R$ is that of “earlier than”, and the series is therefore a B-series, the series <em>can</em> be counted as a process of perpetual qualitive change.</p>

<p>(C) the series <em>cannot</em> be counted as a process of perpetual qualitative change unless <em>each term</em> of it changes in respect of a certain characteristic.</p>

<p>(D) The only characteristics in respect of which the individual terms can change are A-characteristcs (degree of futurity, presentness and pastness).</p>

<p>(E) Therefore, unless the terms of a series have A-characteristics and can change in respect of these, the series cannot be a process of qualitative change.</p>

<p>And therefore, its gernerating relation $R$ cannot be that of “earlier than” and the series cannot be a B-series.</p>

<h3 id="justification-of-this-account-of-mctaggarts-doctrine">2.2.2. Justification of this account of McTaggart’s doctrine</h3>

<p>(1) The McTaggart’s statement “time involves change.” is highly ambiguous. Firstly, it might be referred to qualitative change, or might be referred to change with respect to temporal characteristics. Secondly, even if he were referring to qualitative change, he might or might not mean that there must <em>always</em> be qualitative change going on somewhere if temporal characteristics are to apply within the univers. </p>

<p>He say: “The time-series consists of terms, joined by the relation of earlier and later, which terms are different in their <em>non-temoral qualities</em>” The word “non-tempral” is essential for my purpose. </p>

<p>(2) McTaggart admits and asserts that we should say that a qualitative change takes place if and only if there are qulitatively dissimilar terms related by the relation of “earlier than”. </p>

<p>His objective to Russell’s analysis is that, unless the terms had A-characteristics and changed in respect of them, the relation between them could not be that of “earlier than”, and the series of qualitatively dissimilar terms could not consitute a process of qualitative change. ((a), (b), (c))</p>

<p>(3) It is true that McTaggart talks of “facts”, and not of “events”, as changing. But McTaggart was always liable to use the word “fact” loosely, and it is certain that he often used it to mean “event”. Moreover, the “facts” which are said to change are facts about the A-characteristics of events.</p>

<p>(4) (311 and 315-317).</p>

<p>One more: McTaggart nowhere asserts, or claims to have proved, that the relation “earlier than” can be <em>defined</em> in terms of past, present and future. But afterward, he thought he had shown that “earlier than” can be <em>defined</em> in terms of A-characteristics, whilst the converse dose not hold. This apears to be a much more radical dictrine than any that is stated or augued for in Chap. XXXIII.</p>

<h3 id="mctaggarts-reasons-for-his-doctrine">2.2.3. McTaggart’s reasons for his doctrine</h3>

<p>(1) (About (A) and (B)) In fact, granted that there could not be succession without <em>occational</em> qualitative change, is it obvious that there could not be succession without <em>perpetual</em> qualitative change?</p>

<p>(2) The essential point which McTaggart has to prove is that a series of qualitatively dissimlilar terms sould not counted as a  process of qualitative change unless <em>each term</em> changed in respect of certain characteristics. McTaggart’s argument may be summarised as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Suppose, if possible, that there sould be a B-series of terms which had no A-characteristics, and therefore of terms which could not change in respect of A-characteristics.</li>
  <li>Then this series could not constitute a process of qualitative change. But, unless there be qualitative change, no temporal characteristics have any application.</li>
  <li>Now the relation “earlier than”, which relates the terms of a B-series, is a tempral relation.</li>
  <li>Therefore the supposition that there could be a B-series of terms which had no A-characteristics must be refected as impossible.</li>
</ol>

<p>Why B-series of terms which had no A-characteristics could not constitute a process of qualitative change? His argument is as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A process of qualitative change could not consist in the annihilation of one event insuch a sereies and the generation of another event in place of it.</li>
  <li>A process of qualitative chenge could not consist in one event “merging into” another, so that they have a slice in common.</li>
  <li>The only alternative left is that each term in a B-series changes in respect of certain chararteristics: A-characteristics.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are two questions to be raised about this argumet:</p>

<p><strong>(1) Are the alternative analyses of qualitative change with McTaggart here proposes exhaustive?</strong></p>

<p>Russell’s theory: There are certain series of successive events, such that the members of any one such series are intimately interconnected by certain spatial, causal, and other relations, which do not interconnect members of any two such series. Each such series is counted as the history of adiffernt thing. Now successive members of one such series may differ in respect of a certain quality. </p>

<p>“The thing $T$ changes from $q_1$ to $q_2$” is completely analysable into “There is a certain series of successive events so interrelated that it counts as the history of a certain thing $T$; $e_1$ and $e_2$ are two successive adjoined phases in this series; and $e_1$ has $Q$ in the form $q_1$ whilst $e_2$ has $Q$ in the form $q_2$.”</p>

<p>McTaggart has two objections. The first is irrelevant; and the second is an <em>ignoratio elenchi</em>.</p>

<p><strong>(2) Is he justified in rejecting the first two of the three alternatives which he considers?</strong></p>

<p>The basis of his rejection is the principle that, if $X$ <em>ever</em> precedes $Y$ by a certain amount, then it always precedes $Y$ by precisely that amount. This principle is supposed to be incompatible with the view that events are generated and annihilated. </p>

<p>“The Battle of Hastings precedes the Battle of Waterloo by 749 years.” Such phraseology would suggest that the two events are two particulars which (a) somehow <em>co-exist</em> either timelessly or simultaneously, and yet (b) stand timelessly or sempitiernally in a certain <em>temptoral</em> relation of precedence. This must be nonsense.</p>

<p>That events cannot be annihilated or generated would be incompatible with the fact that they <em>always</em> stand in the determinate temporal relation in which they do stand to each other.</p>

<h3 id="restatement-of-the-position">2.2.4 Restatement of the position</h3>

<p>There is a set of terms such that at any moment every A-characteristic belongs to one or other of them, each of them has one and only one A-characteristic, and no two of them have the same A-characteristic. These changes are so adjusted that the <em>algebraical difference</em> between the A-characteristics of any two terms remains constant and independent of the <em>absolute values</em> of their A-characteristcs.</p>

<p>A simple way of stating the theory is as follows. </p>

<p>Take the sentence “It is now raining.” A number of utterances may occur at different times, which are all alike enough in the relevant respects to count as utterances of this sentence. Now any one who utters this sentence seriously on any occasion means to express his belief that an occurrence of rain falling in his neighbourhood is simutaneous with this utterance of his. And so does anyone who hears and understands.</p>

<p>Thus any utterance $U$ of the type-sentence “It is raining now” means “An occurrence of rain in the neighbourhood of the speaker who utters $U$ is simultaneous with this utterence.” We may abbreviate this into “An occurrence of rain in spatio-temporally contiguous with the utterance $U$.” Different utterances of the same type-setntence necessarily have different meanings (from the speaker and hearer). If the two utterances are successive, it may well be that one expresses a true proposition and the other a false proposition, though both are utterances of the same type-sentence “It is raining now.”</p>

<p>Can this theory be accepted? I don’t believe it is the meaning of the <em>speaker</em>. </p>
